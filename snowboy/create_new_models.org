- since snowboy was deprecated, there has been no way to train new models, but someone recently figured out how to do it
* steps:
-
- record 3 audio files on the ancilla rpi which are used to train the model
  - using `arecord --device=plughw:1,0 -r 16000 -f S16_LE fileX.wav`
- scp them to local computer
- clone [[https://github.com/rhasspy/snowboy-seasalt][this]] repo
- run server with `docker run -it -p 8000:8000 rhasspy/snowboy-seasalt`
- Generate the pmdl model file with:
  - `curl \
      -X POST \
      -F modelName=okay-rhasspy \
      -F example1=@file1.wav \
      -F example2=@file2.wav \
      -F example3=@file3.wav \
      --output model.pmdl \
      localhost:8000/generate`
